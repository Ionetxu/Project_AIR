# Barcelona air quality analysis
  >“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.” Sherlock Holmes, “A Study in Scarlett” (Arthur Conan Doyle)

My name is Jone Lerchundi and I have worked as a BI consultant for more than 8 years helping companies to understand and leverage useful insights from data. Following my passion for data, I have recently studied a [Masters in Data Science](https://kschool.com/cursos/master-en-data-science-barcelona/) (13th promotion) at Kschool with the idea of expanding my skills and learning new tools and ideas that data science offers to better understand, capture and explain stories from data.

This thesis has been written as a final project for my Masters in Data Science, but it is also a personal project as I am committed to also using my analytical skills to fight the current climate and environmental  emergency that we are facing. This is a work in progress project and my intention is to continue getting useful insights and information and share them for further conciousness.

I am still learning so if you see anything wrong in my code or my assumptions, or you have any questions or new ideas that can help with this project, please don't hesitate to contact me, I will be more than happy to hear from you. 

You can find me in my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonelerchundi/).

# Scope

In this project, I have three main objectives:

- To understand the pollution trends, drivers and additional insights.
- Create a forecasting model to anticipate pollution episodes. 
- Conduct analysis and create visualizations by leveraging Tableau. 


# Approach

The project has been elaborated by using:

- Initial data preparation with Python in Jupyter notebook. 
- R Studio for data cleaning,preparation, exploration and forecasting.
- Tableau for additional data analysis and communication of insights.
- Github for version control.
- Google drive to store the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmwf6u5mLPZQ0XiBu7RRd33KAPkHuCAQ/view?usp=sharing).

The scripts in R and python notebook, as well as visualizations done in Tableau are hosted in this Project_AIR Github repository.

# Data

You can download all the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmwf6u5mLPZQ0XiBu7RRd33KAPkHuCAQ/view?usp=sharing) here. Just download the "Archive.zip" file to get the datasets. 

# Prerequisites
 
- To run the Jupyter notebook, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7).
- To run R scripts, I recommnend installing [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
- To open the Tableau visualizations, please download [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).
